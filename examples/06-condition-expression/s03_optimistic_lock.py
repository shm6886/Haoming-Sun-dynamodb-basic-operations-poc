"""
06-condition-expression / s03 — manual optimistic locking.

Two clients read the same row, both want to update it, and we need
exactly one to win without using a database lock. The standard
optimistic-locking pattern:

1. Each row carries a ``version`` number.
2. On read, remember the version.
3. On write, condition on ``version == <remembered>`` and increment
   ``version`` in the same update.

The first writer wins (server's version was equal). The second writer's
condition fails because the server's version has been bumped — they
must refresh and retry.

(For a built-in alternative, use ``pynamodb.attributes.VersionAttribute``.
We do it by hand here so the mechanism is visible.)
