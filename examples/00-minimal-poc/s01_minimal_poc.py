00-minimal-poc — minimal end-to-end POC.

The "Golden Reference" for the whole ``examples/`` series. Walks through the
full pynamodb lifecycle with the fewest lines possible:

1. Define a pynamodb ``Model`` (``Card``) — one Python class == one table.
2. Create the table on the AWS account behind ``bsm`` (skip if it exists).
3. Wipe existing rows so the script is idempotent — keep the table itself
   to avoid the ``create_table`` wait on every run.
4. ``save`` one row.
5. ``get`` it back and print.
6. A commented-out ``Card.delete_table()`` is left at the end; uncomment it
   when you want to drop the table entirely.

Run::
