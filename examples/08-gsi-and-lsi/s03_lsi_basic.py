"""
08-gsi-and-lsi / s03 — basic LSI.

An LSI shares the main table's partition key but uses a **different**
sort key. It lets you re-sort the rows of a single partition by a
different attribute.

Main table:  PK = card_id, SK = tx_ts        (transactions sorted by time)
LSI:         PK = card_id, SK = amount       (transactions sorted by amount)

Use case: "find the top-3 biggest transactions on this card."

LSI caveats:

- Must be created at table-creation time. You cannot add or remove an
  LSI later — you have to recreate the table.
- The hash key must match the main table's hash key.
- Up to 5 LSIs per table; up to 10 GB of data per partition key (the
  main table normally has no per-partition cap).
- Strongly consistent reads are supported on an LSI (unlike GSIs).
